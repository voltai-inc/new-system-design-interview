Do all I/O pins on the TC397 include internal clamping diodes to both ground and VCC?,"Yes, there are diode-like structures for all I/O lines - see Figure 94

How fast can I sample four ADC channels using a single ADC converter on the TC397?,"The speed at which you can read 4 ADCs with a single converter depends on the specific ADC configuration and conversion time.  The sampling time is application dependent, but can be as fast as 
375 ns per channel.  Refer to 32.9 Conversion Timing in the User Manual.
It's also important to make sure your external filter has the right components to achieve your desired sampling frequency.  Refer to AP32362 AD converter supply and PCB design guidelines for more information.",TC3XX_User_Manual_part2.pdf,"TC3XX_User_Manual_part1.pdf, TC3XX_User_Manual_part2.pdf, TC39X_datasheet.pdf, TC39X_errata_sheet.pdf, TC39X_user_manual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol1-usermanual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol2-usermanual.pdf, TC39X_addendum_datasheet.pdf"
What software timeout should I budget for a full device flash erase on the TC36x?,"The datasheet specifies a maximum multi‑sector program‑flash erase time of 0.5 s, leading to a 5.0 s maximum for a complete device erase. The errata revises these maxima for the TC36x AA‑step to 0.52 s per multi‑sector erase and 5.16 s for a full device erase. Software timeouts should therefore be set above the errata‑corrected values, not the original datasheet limits.","TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf","TC3XX_User_Manual_part1.pdf, TC3XX_User_Manual_part2.pdf, TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf, TC36X_user_manual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol1-usermanual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol2-usermanual.pdf"
What is the maximum practical QSPI speed on the TC364?,"duplex and half‑duplex modes are limited to 20 MBaud, while simplex mode is supported up to 50 MBaud, allowing a 20 ns SCLKO period only in simplex operation. Both constraints must be considered together when selecting the QSPI baud rate.","TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf","TC3XX_User_Manual_part1.pdf, TC3XX_User_Manual_part2.pdf, TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf, TC36X_user_manual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol1-usermanual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol2-usermanual.pdf"
Can I rely on periodically trimming the backup clock (every 2 ms) to maintain LIN timing accuracy across temperature?,"While the datasheet includes a footnote suggesting that periodic trimming every 2 ms could maintain LIN‑compliant accuracy up to high temperatures, the errata explicitly states that this condition cannot be guaranteed under all operating conditions and that the footnote should be disregarded. As a result, LIN designs should not depend on that trimming assumption alone.","TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf","TC3XX_User_Manual_part1.pdf, TC3XX_User_Manual_part2.pdf, TC36X_datasheet.pdf, TC36X_errata_sheet.pdf, TC36X_user_manual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol1-usermanual.pdf, aurix-architecture-vol2-usermanual.pdf"
How many GPIOs are available on the TC364?,"The answer is indeed in a single TC36x datasheet, but not in one or two places. This is a counting problem across many tables in the datasheet.
